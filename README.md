# **ML Pipeline with DVC for Efficient MLOps**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates a comprehensive Machine Learning (ML) pipeline, built using Data Version Control (DVC). The pipeline covers all essential steps from data ingestion to model evaluation, ensuring reproducibility, scalability, and efficient collaboration. By leveraging DVC, we ensure seamless version control for both data and models, making it ideal for MLOps workflows.

### **Key Components**
1. **data_ingestion.py**: Script to fetch and prepare the raw data.
2. **data_preprocessing.py**: Processes the raw data, handling cleaning and transformation.
3. **feature_engineering.py**: Generates meaningful features for model training.
4. **model_building.py**: Trains a machine learning model using Gradient Boosting Classifier.
5. **model_evaluation.py**: Evaluates the trained model and stores the performance metrics.

## **Pipeline Overview**
The entire ML pipeline is orchestrated through the `dvc.yaml` file, which defines each stage of the process:

- **Data Ingestion**: Fetches the raw data and stores it in the `data/raw` directory.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Processes the raw data and stores the processed data in `data/processed`.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generates features and stores them for model input.
- **Model Building**: Trains the model and saves the trained model file.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model and records the performance metrics.

### **dvc.yaml Structure**

  data_ingestion:
    cmd: python src/data_ingestion.py

```

## **Why DVC?**

DVC (Data Version Control) is essential for managing the complexity of machine learning projects:

- **Data Versioning**: DVC tracks and versions large datasets and models, enabling seamless experiment management.
- **Reproducibility**: Every stage of the pipeline is version-controlled, allowing you to recreate any experiment or model with confidence.
- **Pipeline Automation**: DVC connects each step of your ML pipeline, automating dependencies and outputs.
- **Collaboration**: By handling data, models, and pipelines in a version-controlled environment, DVC enhances teamwork, reducing conflicts and boosting productivity.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- DVC installed (`pip install dvc`)
- Git installed
- VS Code or any preferred IDE

### **Setup and Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Initialize DVC**:
   ```bash
   dvc init
   ```

4. **Add Data to DVC**:
   Ensure that your datasets are versioned:
   ```bash
   dvc add data/raw/train.csv
   ```

5. **Run the Pipeline**:
   Execute the entire ML pipeline:
   ```bash
   dvc repro
   ```

6. **Visualize the Pipeline**:
   To understand the pipeline structure:
   ```bash
   dvc dag
   ```

7. **Push Data and Models to Remote Storage (Optional)**:
   If you want to save your data and models remotely:
   ```bash
   dvc remote add -d myremote s3://mybucket/dvcstore
   dvc push
   ```

### **Running the Project in VS Code**

1. **Open the Project Folder**: Open the root directory in VS Code.
2. **Run Individual Scripts**: You can run individual scripts like `data_ingestion.py` in the integrated terminal.
3. **Run the Entire Pipeline**: Use the terminal to run `dvc repro`, which will execute all pipeline stages.
4. **Monitor Output**: Check the outputs generated in the respective directories like `data/processed` and `models`.

## **Conclusion**

By using DVC, we've ensured that this machine learning pipeline is reproducible, scalable, and ready for collaboration. The integration of DVC into MLOps practices empowers the team to experiment, track, and manage changes effectively.
